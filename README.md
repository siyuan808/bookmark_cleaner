A fun project of a chrome extension writen using jquery:
This chrome extension that could help you find out your most likely unwanted bookmarks with the infomation of your browsing history. 
It filters out the bookmarks that you haven't visited for a certain time. You can cusomize this time periodical, but strongly
suggest you keep this value larger than 30 days. The longer this time is, the less the suggested bookmars are, and thus the more
likely the suggestion are up to your will.
